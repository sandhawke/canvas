# canvas
[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]

simple shared drawing tool (demo)

## Motivation

I want to show how webdup can be used, and maybe more.

## Notes

Let's start with [Drawing Graphics | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Drawing_graphics) (and maybe later look at [Drawing Shapes | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Drawing_shapes)

We'll use the app at <https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/apis/drawing-graphics/loops_animation/8_canvas_drawing_app.html>

```terminal
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/javascript/apis/drawing-graphics/loops_animation/8_canvas_drawing_app.html
```

Then we'll make some changes to it.
